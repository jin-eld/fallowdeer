# Fallow Deer - identify and track individual fallow deer from video footage

The goal of this project is to process photo and video material in order to
identify individual fallow deer which appear in the footage. The information
about the appearances will be stored and should allow tracking individual
animals over a period of time. It could also be used for counting the
population of fallow deer in the monitored area.
